It looks like the file is not available under my local workspace because the file is only moved in the document root when bundling polygerrit.  The redirect works around that.\n\nFor fonts, I remember Ben told me it was a known issue, I went ahead and fixed it by reading the files outside the document root. I have used `path.basename()` to avoid path traversal (like `/fonts/etc/shadow` would end up serving `/etc/shadow`). Then for a dev server, I don\u0027t think we have to be too paranoid :)",
