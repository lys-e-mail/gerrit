It was less than 3 microseconds for each of those calls.\n\n\u003e Have you explored the option of skipping this altogether if there are no listeners implementing the `TaskParker` interface?\n\nDo you still think this option needs to be explored given there isn\u0027t a considerable overhead? L598-L623 should mostly be no-op if there are no listeners.",
