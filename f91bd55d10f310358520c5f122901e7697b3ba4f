      "message": "I have added the logic to hide the checkbox when `gerrit.projectStatePredicateEnabled \u003d false` which comes from parent change https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/432317/ . The web UI defaults it to true since in most case it is never set and the predicate is enabled.\n\nI have renamed the variable from `hideReadOnlyRepo` to `showActiveRepos` since checking it causes the project to be filtered based on `state:active` and that the mismatching semantic was annoying me.\n\nI have tested it locally with `gerrit.projectStatePredicateEnabled` not set, set to true and set to false and I got the expected behavior (it is shown in both first two cases and hidden when config is false).",
